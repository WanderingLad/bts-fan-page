            Bio: 
        </h2>
        <p>
            A South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under 
            Big Hit Entertainment. The septet co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. 
            Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide 
            range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, 
            touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of 
            age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also 
            often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative 
            universe storyline.
